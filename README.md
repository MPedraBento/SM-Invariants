# Brief description

In the Standard Model of particle physics, the flavor sector is responsible for many processes in electroweak physics such as beta decay, kaon osciillation and charge-parity violation. The description of such processes is often dependent on the parametrization and, sometimes, depedent on the basis. We study the invariants of the $H_u$ and $H_d$ matrices in the quark sector.

# Notebook description

The notebook does a random search in the parameter space of flavor physics and uses this and the experimental values for the CKM and quark masses to define flavor invariants. These, in turn, are plotted and studied against each other. We answer the question: where is the SM located in the invariant space? We proceed the study the RGEs of the SM's flavor invariants.
We the impact of the CKM parameters in the flavor invariants by using a Random Forest algorithm.
